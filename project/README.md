## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### Frontend

1. **React + Vite**
   - Pros: Fast development, excellent HMR, small bundle size
   - Trade-off: Newer tooling might have fewer resources/solutions for edge cases

2. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Pros: Rapid UI development, consistent styling, small production bundle
   - Trade-off: HTML can become verbose with utility classes

3. **Single Page Application**
   - Pros: Smooth user experience, no page reloads
   - Trade-off: Initial bundle size, SEO considerations

### Backend

1. **Express.js**
   - Pros: Lightweight, flexible, large ecosystem
   - Trade-off: Manual setup required for features that might be built-in with fuller frameworks

2. **Multer for File Upload**
   - Pros: Simple integration, memory storage for quick processing
   - Trade-off: Limited to smaller files due to memory storage

3. **PDF-Parse Library**
   - Pros: Simple API, good text extraction
   - Trade-off: Limited formatting preservation, might miss some complex PDF features

### API Design

1. **Single Endpoint Architecture**
   - Pros: Simple to understand and implement
   - Trade-off: Less flexibility for future features

2. **Synchronous Processing**
   - Pros: Immediate results, simple implementation
   - Trade-off: Might not scale well with large files or high concurrency

## Future Improvements

1. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Implement file size limits and validation
   - Add support for batch processing multiple PDFs
   - Implement caching for repeated analyses
   - Add support for more document formats (DOC, DOCX, TXT)

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Advanced text analysis (readability scores, sentiment analysis)
   - Custom stop words lists
   - Comparative analysis between multiple documents
   - Export results in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, Excel)
   - Save analysis history
   - User authentication and saved preferences

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement worker threads for PDF processing
   - Add request queuing for large files
   - Implement progress tracking for large documents
   - Add file compression before upload

4. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add dark mode support
   - Implement responsive visualizations for analysis results
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Improve accessibility features
   - Add localization support

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Add automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Add monitoring and error tracking
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add API versioning
